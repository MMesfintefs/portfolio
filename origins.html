      <p>
        Born on March 12, the day of Saint Michael, Michael Mesfin Tefera grew up carrying a name that meant strength and protection long before he understood what those words required. He was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in a household where business, finance, and responsibility were part of daily life. Decision-making was not abstract. It was practical, visible, and constant.
      </p>

      <p>
        An only child, Michael learned early how to be adaptable, observant, and internally driven. He developed the habit of analyzing situations before reacting, reading environments before stepping into them, and understanding people before trying to influence outcomes. He was naturally drawn to helping others improve their experience, whether in school, on teams, or in everyday interactions. Elevating the environment around him became second nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        He attended Ethio-Parents’ School (Gerji Campus), where strong academics met relentless curiosity. That curiosity rarely stayed theoretical. As a child, Michael was known for dismantling whatever he could get his hands on — phones, radios, toys, bikes, small electronics — studying how each piece worked, then rebuilding them exactly as they were. Nothing stayed broken. Each object became a system to understand, a puzzle to solve, a quiet exercise in reverse engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        What looked like mischief was actually pattern recognition in its earliest form. He wasn’t trying to break things. He was trying to understand how parts connect, where failure happens, and how structure creates function. That instinct would later define his approach to business, systems, and analytics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside academics, Michael stayed active in sports — basketball, football (soccer), tennis, and Taekwondo, where he earned a red belt with black stripe. Sports reinforced discipline, resilience, and composure under pressure. Challenges did not drain him; they energized him. In a professional context, he developed a comfort with high-pressure environments and complex problems, viewing stress not as a threat but as a signal that growth is happening. Persistence became a defining trait. Once he commits, he sees things through.
      </p>

      <p>
        From high school onward, Michael was drawn to the idea that the future of business would be inseparable from technology. Even before he had full access to advanced tools, he sensed that decision-making would increasingly depend on systems, data, and structured thinking rather than instinct alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        That belief followed him to the United States in Fall 2021, when he began his undergraduate studies in International Business. He moved with intention — not just to earn a degree, but to expand his range. He completed the core of his International Business program in roughly two and a half years, taking heavy course loads and progressing quickly. But stopping there felt incomplete.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael had always believed business and technology belonged together. So in his third year, he deliberately expanded his academic path by adding Management Information Systems and Business Administration. MIS gave him a formal framework for understanding how information flows through organizations, how systems support decisions, and how data becomes actionable insight. Business Administration strengthened the leadership and operational side of that equation.
      </p>

      <p>
        During this time, analytics and data stopped being interesting tools and became essential infrastructure. Michael began to see data not as numbers, but as a control mechanism — a way to reduce uncertainty, manage risk, and make decisions that hold up in real environments. Analytics, for him, became the bridge between curiosity and precision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, the child who once dismantled objects to understand them became a professional who dissects systems, processes, and decisions with the same mindset — only now the stakes are higher, the environments are more complex, and the impact is broader.
      </p>

      <p>
        The through-line has never changed: understand how things work, improve what can be improved, and approach every challenge with resilience, curiosity, and disciplined analysis.

        Michael doesn’t just work with systems. He thinks in them.
