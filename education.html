      <p>
        Michael’s academic path reflects a deliberate progression: from foundational business understanding to the structured integration of systems, technology, and analytics.
      </p>

      <p>
        He began his undergraduate studies at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in International Business. Driven by discipline and long-term vision, he consistently carried heavy course loads and completed the core of his degree in roughly two and a half years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than stopping at a single specialization, Michael expanded his academic scope. Recognizing early that modern organizations operate at the intersection of business strategy and technological systems, he added Management Information Systems and Business Administration as additional majors. This decision was not about collecting credentials — it was about building a complete operational perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        International Business developed his global and strategic mindset. Business Administration strengthened his understanding of organizational leadership, operations, and decision structures. Management Information Systems provided the technical and systems framework that connected information, infrastructure, and data-driven execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        During this period, analytics moved from being an academic subject to becoming a professional discipline. Courses involving data analysis, systems modeling, and decision support shaped his understanding of how structured information can reduce uncertainty and guide effective action.
      </p>

      <p>
        After completing his undergraduate studies, Michael continued his academic progression at Bentley University’s McCallum Graduate School of Business, where he is pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics. Graduate study sharpened his focus on applied analytics, statistical modeling, data-driven decision-making, and performance optimization within real organizational environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the graduate level, analytics is not treated as theory, but as infrastructure. Michael approaches data as a tool for governance, risk mitigation, and sustainable decision-making — ensuring that strategies are supported by evidence and that execution aligns with measurable outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="storyClose">
        Education, for Michael, has never been about degrees alone. It has been about building the systems-level perspective required to lead, analyze, and improve complex organizations.
